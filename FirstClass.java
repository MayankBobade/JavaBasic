// below is the template to write any code in java
//we have to save the file with the name of the class in our code
class FirstClass{
    public static void main(String args[]){ // S of string is capital
       System.out.println("hello world"); //S of system is also capital
    }
}

//how does our code run?
//okay so our code goes through two process 1>compilation and 2>execution
//source code goes to compiler which is present in jdk ,compiler converts source code to bytecode.class(ext->.class).
//this byte code can be runned ion any system,hence we call jva a portable language,NOTE  we cannot do this with cpp.
//jvm converts this byte code to native/machine language binary code.

//jdk(java developement kit) contains a component called as jre(java runtime enviornment)and jre also contains a component called as jvm(java virtual machine).
